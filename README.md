# Wave Effect Video Generator

This program generates a video with a wave effect applied to an input image. The wave effect simulates a rippling motion that intensifies towards the bottom of the image.

## How it Works

The program uses OpenCV to read an input image and creates a video by applying a sinusoidal wave pattern to the image. As the video progresses, the phase of the wave changes, creating a rippling effect.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajaimaxwel-pmd/python_wave_generator
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd python_wave_generator
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

### Input and Output

- **Input Image**: `lake.jpg` (Replace with your preferred image) ![lake.jpg](lake.jpg)
- **Output Video**: `output_video.mp4` (The generated video with the wave effect applied) ![output_video_to-gif.gif](output_video_to-gif.gif)
